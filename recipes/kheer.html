		A Rice Kheer recipe that is a keeper and my familyâ€™s heirloom recipe that you will love for its deliciousness. This traditional Indian rice pudding made with basmati rice, whole milk, sugar, nuts, saffron and cardamom is slow-cooked to perfection making for a rich, creamy kheer. I share our favorite rice kheer recipe that is made easy with my stepwise photos and video.
